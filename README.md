# moolib 
moo standard library

Essentially this is a set of general functions, data structures and algorithms we use at mooflower.  Feel free to raid it for your own use for whatever legal (!) purpose you choose, and the code is provided as is and, though unlikely, may contain bugs for which we take no responsibility for.  Consider this code a starting point for your own code which you should test thoroughly.  A credit in a comment in your source code is required.
